A selenium bot logs into your replika account in order to speak with your replika through a discord account in a certain channel.

# How to install

```
pip install selenium
pip install bs4
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade git+https://github.com/Merubokkusu/Discord-S.C.U.M.git#egg=discum
```
if the last bit fails try:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Merubokkusu/Discord-S.C.U.M.git#egg=discum
```
fill out "settings template.json" with the correct details of your replika and discord account then rename the file to "settings.json". then you are ready to run.
